digital_forensics_kali_linux
Where I left off:

* I created a rescue script to be ran in Kali Linux environment
* made hardware clone of Donnie 500GB disk; it is still in the docking station.
* created 500gb disk image file of donnie 500GB disk and stored it on a 2TB drive mounted on my motherboard of Jarvis
* created 2TB disk image file of donnie 2TB drive - I have stored the file ont he 4TB HDD that I have in my HDD storage box.
* i have the log files of both rescue.sh ddrescue runs on the thumb drive along with the rescue script
* next steps: copy thumbdrive log files and rescue script to this repo; setup autopsy on windows workstation to analyze the disk image files I have created backups of and see if I can rescue Donnie files (specifically the 2TB image file)
* I have added the chat gpt conversation from which I taylored/created the rescue.sh script and decided to use Kali Linux to safely mount disks and create disk image back files, etc.
